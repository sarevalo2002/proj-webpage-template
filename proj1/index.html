<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>
  <p>In this project I implemented a rasterizer which is capable of supersampling, utilizing barycentric coordinates, pixel sampling, and level sampling all in an effort to provide antialiasing to images
    which allows them, when rendered, to look smoother due to smaller choppy areas of the image being blurred. Also a smaller but still cool aspect of the rasterizer is the ability to apply transformations.
    As a whole this project is an application of the importance of constructing images via a series of triangles, and how antialiasing can be done in a variety of different ways (each with a different cost
    in the form of speed or memory). I’ve learned a lot from this project, one of which is the peculiarities that go into implementing these seemingly “simple” concepts. Even checking if a point lies inside
    a triangle requires calculating a boundary box of pixels and then computing a series of line-tests to see if the point lies inside (or possibly on the bound) of the triangle. One concept that I learned
    most from this project is just how mipmaps are used as a means of antialiasing. Before the project I had a general idea of how they worked and what they did, but it wasn’t until I implemented it first-hand
    that I saw what each level represented and how they could be used to antialias different triangles based on the best mipmap level for each one. Overall, I quite enjoyed building a rasterizer and I learned a
    lot about how much goes into rendering even a single triangle (also I love barycentric coordinates now they make so much of rasterization make sense).</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p>Here is an example 2x2 gridlike structure using an HTML table. Each <b>tr</b> is a row and each <b>td</b> is a column in that row. You might find this useful for framing and showing your result images in an organized fashion.</p>

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/image1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Caption goes here.</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/image2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Caption goes here.</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/image3.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Caption goes here.</figcaption>
      </td>
